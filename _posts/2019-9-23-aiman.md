## Introduction: 

Weather forecasting is one of the challenging areas that typically require sophisticated models. <br /> in this blog I'm going to predict a weather temperature using a simple linear regression model, then we will see how accurate it will be.



## Data requirement:

The data will be scraped from Weather Underground which is a commercial weather service providing real-time weather information over the Internet.

## methodology: 

This blog will be divided into three stages, we will start by scraping the data from a website, then we will clean the data to be ready for modeling, after that I will build the model and trying to get the appropriate model by applying feature engineering.

## Scraping:

Two tools are important here, selenium and beautifulsoup, if we look at the source code of the website we see that the data were represented by Javascript file that's mean I can not parse the data unless I use selenium, so that I'm using both selenium and beautifulsoup.

For a more accurate result, I have scraped the last 7 years, starting from 2013 till now.

Each page contains the weather data of one month, that's mean we have to parse 84 pages.

My strategy is, first make a list and gather all HTML pages on the list,  then go over the list and scrape what I need, now we have a data and this data should be saved as a data frame, finally, I concatenate data frames to be one data frame.

At the end of this stage, we have a data frame with these features:
- Time,
- Temperature,
- Dew Point,
- Humidity,
- Wind Speed, 
- Pressure,
- Precipation. 

## Cleaning and visualization :
All the data we have are sorted as string so we need to convert it to integer.<br />
If we look at the dataset it contains a max, min, and average, for each feature, but I only need the average, but some features do not have average, so I calculated the for them and drop the max and min from all the features, also I have dropped Precipation because itâ€™s always 0.
### Heatmap:

From the heatmap, we can see there is a strong relationship between, Temperature and Dew Point after doing some research,I have figured out both are the measurement of temperature, so I have dropped Dew Point.

### Boxplot:
##### Boxplot of average Temperature with outliers

##### Boxplot of average Humidity with outliers
![Image4]({{site.url}}/images/with_outlier_avg_humid.png)

the useful of boxplot is we can determine the outliers so, I have plotted the boxplot and I found there are some outliers, and these outliers should be removed!
##### Boxplot of average Temperature without outliers

Now the outliers removed from all features,it's important to take care of outliers because it will affect your model.

### diagnostic plots:
here we will check if the features can fit into a liner model or not!
I have three features which are:
#### Humidity with Temperature

#### Wind Speed with Temperature
![Image5]({{site.url}}/images/diagnostic_plot_3.png)
#### Pressure with Temperature

All three graphs are looks good, they fit into regrassion, the Residual plot is random and the points in QQ plot are on or near from the fit line.

## Modeling:
First model:
In this model, I got R^2 : 0.182 , which is bad !
This is the reual plot of it 

second model: 
What if I add a new feature? which is season? It will improve the accuracy of our model? we have 4 seasons, so each month will belong to has season.  
the R^2 is 0.631, great improvement!
third model:
if we look at histgram of the average temperature it's a little bit  skewed to right, but one of the assumptions of linear regression is the feature should be normally distributed, to transform it we need to take the log, let us take the log and see the result.
the R^2 is 0.605, no improvement, but the result more accurate because of the assumptions of linear regression.

I have constructed others model and apply some transformation but there is no improvement, so I'll stop at this point.

there is many unit in each stations,this the top 5 units on the top station (34 ST-PENN STA)
