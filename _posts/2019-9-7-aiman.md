this project takes a case of a company called WomenTechWomenYes and they have a gala which they want the people to come to.---- And they want to send some of their workers to collect attendance sign ups from subway stations.

## Strategy:
We decided that we want to find the most crowded stations at their peak times so that the company could send their workers to these stations at the best times to increase the chances of sign ups. We chose this decision based on the data that was available. 

## Approach: 
we followed 3 steps in our approach, which are: 
* collecting the data: we collected the data from (link) which was available freely for every one.
* understanding the data: after collecting the data we started to understand the data to gain the necessary domain knowledge
* data analysis: at this step we cleaned the data and then analyzed it to find the busiest stations in terms of total flow (number of entries + number of exits). And we also found the busiest times at these stations
